# sales-followup-agent

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered agent that automates sales lead follow-up. The agent:
- Parses new lead messages using OpenAI GPT function calling.
- Sends an automated thank-you email via SMTP.
- Updates a mock CRM stored in a local JSON file.

## Actions Performed
1. Parses natural language input (lead message).
2. Extracts lead name, email, company, and product interest.
3. Sends a follow-up email.
4. Updates CRM data.
